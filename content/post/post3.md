Welcome to my first post for learning Linux. Here, I would like to share a few fundamental terms and definitions related to Linux. Before I proceed, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all contributors who built Linux glossaries. Without the glossaries, I cannot image that suffer that I may have gone through. In your best interest, [KernelGlossary](https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelGlossary) and [Glossary of Linux Terms](https://kc7nyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2006_Bookmatter_BeginningUbuntuLinux.pdf) are the two main sources that I utilized for this post. Moreover, please note that I am writing this series to organize and share what I learned. Therefore, please don't hesitate to comment for any feedback to improve the post.
