## Why I Started to Blog
Frankly, I wasn't always confident in writing. Although I am comfortable with using English, the thought that I do not sound like a **native speaker**, when using casual term, kicks in. *Is my grammar wrong? Is my word choice not ideal? Am I using the word in a wrong way?*

With all concerns, two reason allowed me to write this first post. The first reason is to overcome challenges that I face when using English. I remember a Christian missionary emphasizing the following quote in a retreat.

> If you do nothing, nothing will happen. So challenge yourself!

The message from the missionary hit me hard. The quote allowed me to reflect myself again. I noticed Enoch who is aftraid to use *casual* English because he may not sound like a native speaker. Writing academic texts are no problem. Therefore, I decided to write my blog in casual way to try and overcome the challenge.
