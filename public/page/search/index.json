[{"content":"This post discusses about a recent emotional deterioration that I faced. If you are currently undergoing a challenge, I sincerely wish you to cheer up!!\nThe Disqualification One may wonder: how big of a challenge can a high school student face? Well, I believe regardless of age, countless people encounter emotional challenges. For instance, failing an exam, receiving rejections, and breaking-up with the significant other may cause distress. As a student who wishes to major in pure mathematics, disqualifying from the second stage of team selecting process for the IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad) hit me hard. Please allow me to elaborate.\nMost students in South Korea prepare from the age of 7 to become the representative for the IMO. While I wasn\u0026rsquo;t as intensely prepared compared to the other students, I can proudly say that I gave it my all for past 11 months. I genuinly spent at least 5 hours to at most 10 hours on solving and studying Olympiad style problems without missing a single day. After passing the first stage of the seleting process, I studied harder for the second stage. Because I knew that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the past representatives, my goal for the year 2025 was to qualify to participate in APMO (Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad) by passing the second stage exam of KMO (Korean Mathematical Olympiad). Unfortunately, I was not able to make it.\nOvercoming The Challenge Failing from KMO Stage II has more meaning than just failing for me. I was genuinely worried about my future applications for math programs and motivation to study further for Olympiad mathematics. Moreover, the biggest challenge was that I was not able to fulfill the expectation of other people. Everytime people ask for the result, I need to say that I could not make it. What\u0026rsquo;s more painful than failing the exam is the fact that I need to say unfavorable result outloud numerous times for next few days even if I am aware that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it.\nAs a result, I decided to change my mindset. If anyone asks me about the result, I proudly say that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it. Because I have my final chance next year, I will take the failure from this year as my main motivation. In regard to future applications for math programs, I believe not all participants in summer programs are IMO gold medalist. I began to understand silence radiance with the fact that my hard works and myself are just a tiny bit away from getting a spark for huge fire. Although I cannot make fire right away, I believe smoke, or effort, is an essential indicator that the fire is actually starting.\nThe positive mindset to turn failure into a chance and shame into a motivation allowed me to prepare myself for bigger challenges. Moreover, while walking down the street, I realized that being distress does not change the result. It is only the positive mindset that changes the failure into chance.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really not the end of the world. I believe nothing is impossible if we have the postive mindset to create the future :))\n💬 Comments\nPlease don't hesitate to comment any questions or feedback!!

Here, I would like to share a few fundamental terms and definitions related to Linux. Before I proceed, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all contributors who built Linux glossaries. Without the glossaries, I cannot image that suffer that I may have gone through. In your best interest, KernelGlossary and Glossary of Linux Terms are the two main sources that I utilized for this post. Moreover, please note that I am writing this series to organize and share what I learned. Therefore, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to comment for any feedback to improve the post.\nWhat is Linux and Why Use It? First and foremost, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss what Linux is.\nBasic Linux Terminology Linux Distributions ","date":"2025-12-15T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post/post3/","title":"Linux Day 1: Getting Started"},{"content":"When I first decided to write my blog, I was thrown into bunch of options. I noticed that many of my favorite mathematicians including professor Terence Tao uses wordpress.com. However, I noticed that wordpress.com would generally give less control over my blog, and must pay to utilize many of the features. There I wondered, why don\u0026rsquo;t I build one myself?\nStatic Site Generator (SSG) I had two options of hosting via CMS (Content Management System) or hosting through SSG (Static Site Generator). The main difference is that CMS like Wordpress creates contents dynamically, whereas SSG is simply showing the users a pre-built sites. Here, I realized that most of my blogs would be text based, and does not require dynamic features such as user accounts. Moreover, sites created with SSG is much faster and secure compared to ones created with CMS since no server-side processing is required when accessing.\nNow there are multiple Static Site Generators. I personally found Hugo as the ideal SSG since I will have large amounts of posts, and Hugo is known to be fast with Go\u0026rsquo;s performace.\nAfter generating the blog, there must be a hostig platform to actually deploy it. There are multiple options out there, but I chose to use GitHub Pages because it is free and I store my source codes in GitHub anyway. Here is a link to the sources for those who are interested.\nInstalling Hugo and Making Repository in GitHub To install Hugo, please refer to the official installation guide. If you are on Windows, copy and paste winget install Hugo.Hugo.Extended to your terminal to install. For Mac users with Homebrew, brew install hugo will do the job. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I need to include one for Linux users :))\nFor code editors, I personally use terminal text editor Neovim due to its speed and flexibility. Here is the official installation guide for your interest. However, I believe other code editors are perfectly fine!\nIf you have Hugo and code editor ready to go, we need to create a repository in GitHub. I personally made a public repository named blog. Next, we need to enter following commands in terminal.\ncd BLOG-NAME git init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git remote add origin git push -u origin main Sometimes, you many need to create a token in GitHub to run the final command. When creating, \u0026ldquo;repo\u0026rdquo; section must be checked!\nChoosing Theme To avoid headaches from css and javascript, I decided to use a theme from Hugo Themes. There are great themes in the link to make our life easier, so I chose a theme called Stack.\nTo implement the theme as a submodule, we must run the following commands in your project.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack git submodule update --init --recursive To integrate the theme, please update your hugo.toml. It should include the following.\nbaseURL = \u0026#39;https://YOUR-GITHUB-ID.github.io/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME/\u0026#39; languageCode = \u0026#39;en-us\u0026#39; title = \u0026#34;NAME OF YOUR BLOG\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#39;hugo-theme-stack\u0026#39; [taxonomies] category = \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; tag = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; Creating Initial Post To write a post, create a Markdown file YOUR-POST.md in BLOG-NAME/content/post. For users on Unix-based operating system, touch YOUR-POST.md creates the empty file.\nIn your Markdown file, it sould include the following.\n--- author: YOUR NAME title: YOUR TITLE date: DATE categories: [\u0026#34;YOUR CATEGORY\u0026#34;] --- YOUR CONTENTS After writing your initial post, the following commands must be ran to update the GitHub repository.\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;YOUR-CHANGE\u0026#34; git push Next, in GitHub repository, please check \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; for the published blog.\nYour blog is successfully published!!\n💬 Comments\nPlease don't hesitate to comment any questions or feedback!!

Welcome to my personal blog where I post about various topics! I am a student from South Korea, and is currently attending Laurel Springs School. Please check out my YouTube Channel and GitHub for more information!!\nWhy I Started to Blog Frankly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always confident in writing. Although I am comfortable with using English, the thought that I do not sound like a native speaker, when using casual term, kicks in. Is my grammar wrong? Is my word choice not ideal? Am I using the word in a wrong way?\nWith all concerns, two reason allowed me to write this first post. The first reason is to overcome challenges that I face when using English. I remember a Christian missionary emphasizing the following quote in a retreat.\nIf you do nothing, nothing will happen. So challenge yourself!\nThe message from the missionary hit me hard, and allowed me to reflect myself again. I noticed Enoch who is afraid to use casual English because he may not sound like a native speaker. Writing academic texts are no problem. Therefore, I decided to write my blog in casual way to try and overcome the challenge.\nThe second reason for blogging is to record my academic journey. I found blogging as one of the best method to organize what I learned and share publically. I decided to publish my journey and resources publically in case someone finds them useful and to potentially receive any feedback. Here, I will mainly be blogging about learning Linux and Capture the Flag (CTF). I hope to see improved self when I look back at my posts one day!!\nContents Below are the areas that I dedicate to write about.\nMath As a student pursuing to major in pure mathematics, I love to write about math and share solutions. Although I have published all my works in GitHub, this section is dedicated to topics that I was not able to post publically in GitHub. Maybe I can share my progress and stories behind the scenes :))\nLinux and CTF Most of my posts would be dedicated to Linux and CTF. Broadly speaking, I first gained interest in computer science in my second semester of high school freshman year. I first encountered LaTeX while submitting applications for various Math Summer Programs. After learning to write with Overleaf, I gained interests in coding. But why Linux and CTF?\nI am planning to dedicate a post about this topic. Nevertheless, briefly speaking, I found a fake proof to Fermat\u0026rsquo;s Last Theorem; I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that I have a flaw in the proof before I started writing my proof in research paper style. Before writing the proof in Overleaf, I was concerned about uploading the draft in cloud. It does not mean that I don\u0026rsquo;t trust Overleaf staffs and people envolved with cloud. I realized that countless mathematicians use local LaTeX and code editors to write their drafts. So why not do the same..\nAgain, it does not mean that I do not trust Microsoft. However, I am not a big fan of telemetry involved with Visual Studio Code. Therefore, while looking for an open source code editor, I came across Neovim. Well, first of all, setting up for Neovim and most open source code editors is not an easy task for someone new to computer science. After few hours of fighting with terminal, I finally have Neovim as my main code editor.\nDebugging has different nuance from solving math problem. In other words, I found a new type of challenge!! Although some may say it is too late to start CTF as a high school sophomore, I never think it\u0026rsquo;s too late to learn anything. Yes, I acknowledge that I might not be able to win competitions as a high school student because there are people who studied much more than me and I didn\u0026rsquo;t start CTF as early as I started my journey for math. However, I believe investigating my time in cybersecurity and how computers operate would benefit me in the future.\nStudent Life As I express and organize my thoughts through words, I would like to share my student life. Espescially as a student from an online high school, many people wonder about my daily schedule. Everything is here!!\nMiscellaneous As one may have guessed, this category is for posts that do not fit to categories above :))\n💬 Comments\nPlease don't hesitate to comment any questions or feedback!!
