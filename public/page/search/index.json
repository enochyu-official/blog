[{"content":"Hello!! Welcome to my personal blog where I post about various topics! I am a student from South Korea, and is currently attending Laurel Springs School. Please check out my YouTube Channel and GitHub for more information!!\nWhy I Started to Blog Frankly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always confident in writing. Although I am comfortable with using English, the thought that I do not sound like a native speaker, when using casual term, kicks in. Is my grammar wrong? Is my word choice not ideal? Am I using the word in a wrong way?\nWith all concerns, two reason allowed me to write this first post. The first reason is to overcome challenges that I face when using English. I remember a Christian missionary emphasizing the following quote in a retreat.\nIf you do nothing, nothing will happen. So challenge yourself!\nThe message from the missionary hit me hard, and allowed me to reflect myself again. I noticed Enoch who is afraid to use casual English because he may not sound like a native speaker. Writing academic texts are no problem. Therefore, I decided to write my blog in casual way to try and overcome the challenge.\nThe second reason for blogging is to record my academic journey. I found blogging as one of the best method to organize what I learned and share publically. I decided to publish my journey and resources publically in case someone finds them useful and to potentially receive any feedback. Here, I will mainly be blogging about learning Linux and Capture the Flag (CTF). I hope to see improved self when I look back at my posts one day!!\nContents Below are the areas that I dedicate to write about.\nMath As a student pursuing to major in pure mathematics, I love to write about math and share solutions. Although I have published all my works in GitHub, this section is dedicated to topics that I was not able to post publically in GitHub. Maybe I can share my progress and stories behind the scenes :))\nLinux and CTF Most of my posts would be dedicated to Linux and CTF. Broadly speaking, I first gained interest in computer science in my second semester of high school freshman year. I first encountered LaTeX while submitting applications for various Math Summer Programs. After learning to write with Overleaf, I gained interests in coding. But why Linux and CTF?\nI am planning to dedicate a post about this topic. Nevertheless, briefly speaking, I found a fake proof to Fermat\u0026rsquo;s Last Theorem; I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that I have a flaw in the proof before I started writing my proof in research paper style. Before writing the proof in Overleaf, I was concerned about uploading the draft in cloud. It does not mean that I don\u0026rsquo;t trust Overleaf staffs and people envolved with cloud. I realized that countless mathematicians use local LaTeX and code editors to write their drafts. So why not do the same..\nAgain, it does not mean that I do not trust Microsoft. However, I am not a big fan of telemetry involved with Visual Studio Code. Therefore, while looking for an open source code editor, I came across Neovim. Well, first of all, setting up for Neovim and most open source code editors is not an easy task for someone new to computer science. After few hours of fighting with terminal, I finally have Neovim as my main code editor.\nDebugging has different nuance from solving math problem. In other words, I found a new type of challenge!! Although some may say it is too late to start CTF as a high school sophomore, I never think it\u0026rsquo;s too late to learn anything. Yes, I acknowledge that I might not be able to win competitions as a high school student because there are people who studied much more than me and I didn\u0026rsquo;t start CTF as early as I started my journey for math. However, I believe investigating my time in cybersecurity and how computers operate would benefit me in the future.\nStudent Life As I express and organize my thoughts through words, I would like to share my student life. Espescially as a student from an online high school, many people wonder about my daily schedule. Everything is here!!\nMiscellaneous As one may have guessed, this category is for posts that do not fit to categories above :))\n💬 Comments\nPosting a comment requires a free GitHub account!!

I noticed that many of my favorite mathematicians including professor Terence Tao uses wordpress.com. However, I noticed that wordpress.com would generally give less control over my blog, and must pay to utilize many of the features. There I wondered, why don\u0026rsquo;t I build one myself?\nStatic Site Generator (SSG) I had two options of hosting via CMS (Content Management System) or SSG (Static Site Generator). The main difference is that CMS like Wordpress creates contents dynamically, whereas SSG is simply showing the users a pre-built sites. Here, I realized that most of my blogs would be text based, and does not require dynamic features such as user accounts. Moreover, sites created with SSG is much faster and secure compared to ones rated with CMS since no server-side processing is required when accessing.\nNow there are multiple Static Site Generators. I personally found Hugo as the ideal SSG since I will have large amounts of posts, and Hugo is known to be fast with Go\u0026rsquo;s performace.\nAfter generating the blog, there must be a hostig platform to actually deploy it. There are multiple options out there, but I chose to use GitHub Pages because it is free and I store my source codes in GitHub anyway. Here is a link to the sources for those who are interested.\nInstalling Hugo and Making Repository in GitHub If Hugo and code editors are installed,\nChoosing Theme To avoid headaches from css and javascript, I decided to use a theme from Hugo Themes. There are great themes in the link to make our life easier, so I chose a theme called Stack.\nTo implement the theme as a submodule, we must run the following commands.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack git submodule update --init --recursive My Custom Codes ","date":"2025-12-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post/post2/","title":"Building My Blog With Hugo and GitHub"},{"content":"hello ","date":"2025-12-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post/blog3/","title":"Blog 1"},{"content":"Hello World!!\n","date":"2025-12-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post/blog4/","title":"BLog 4"}]
