[{"content":"Why I Started to Blog Frankly, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always confident in writing. Although I am comfortable with using English, the thought that I do not sound like a native speaker, when using casual term, kicks in. Is my grammar wrong? Is my word choice not ideal? Am I using the word in a wrong way?\nWith all concerns, two reason allowed me to write this first post. The first reason is to overcome challenges that I face when using English. I remember a Christian missionary emphasizing the following quote in a retreat.\nIf you do nothing, nothing will happen. So challenge yourself!\nThe message from the missionary hit me hard. The quote allowed me to reflect myself again. I noticed Enoch who is aftraid to use casual English because he may not sound like a native speaker. Writing academic texts are no problem. Therefore, I decided to write my blog in casual way to try and overcome the challenge.\nContents 💬 Comments\nPosting a comment requires a free GitHub account!!
