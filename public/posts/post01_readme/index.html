        <p>Hello!! Welcome to my personal blog where I post about various topics!
I am a student from South Korea, and is currently attending Laurel
Springs School. Please check out my
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@enochyu_official/">YouTube Channel</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/enochyu-official">GitHub</a> for more information!!</p>
<h2 id="why-i-started-to-blog">Why I Started to Blog</h2>
<p>Frankly, I wasn&rsquo;t always confident in writing. Although I am comfortable
with using English, the thought that I do not sound like a <strong>native speaker</strong>,
when using casual term, kicks in. <em>Is my grammar wrong? Is my word choice
not ideal? Am I using the word in a wrong way?</em></p>
<p>With all concerns, two reason allowed me to write this first post.
The first reason is to overcome challenges that I face when using
English. I remember a Christian missionary emphasizing the following
quote in a retreat.</p>
<pre><code>If you do nothing, nothing will happen. So challenge yourself!
</code></pre>
<p>The message from the missionary hit me hard, and allowed me to reflect
myself again. I noticed Enoch who is afraid to use <em>casual</em> English
because he may not sound like a native speaker. Writing academic texts
are no problem. Therefore, I decided to write my blog in casual way to
try and overcome the challenge.</p>
<p>The second reason for blogging is to record my academic journey. I found
blogging as one of the best method to organize what I learned and share
publicly. I decided to publish my journey and resources publicly in case
someone finds them useful and to potentially receive any feedback. I hope
to see improved self when I look back at my posts one day!!</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<p>Below are the areas that I dedicate to write about.</p>
<h3 id="math">Math</h3>
<p>As a student pursuing to major in pure mathematics, I love to write about
math and share solutions. Although I have published all my works in GitHub,
this section is dedicated to topics that I was not able to post publicly in
GitHub. Maybe I can share my progress and stories behind the scenes :))</p>
<h3 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, I first gained interest in computer science in my second
semester of high school freshman year. I first encountered LaTeX while
submitting applications for various Math Summer Programs. After learning to
write with Overleaf, I gained interests in coding.</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, I found a <em>fake proof</em> to Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem; I didn&rsquo;t
realize that I have a flaw in the proof before I started writing my proof in
research paper style. Before writing the proof in Overleaf, I was concerned
about uploading the draft in cloud. It <strong>does not</strong> mean that I don&rsquo;t trust
Overleaf staffs and people involved with cloud. I realized that countless
mathematicians use local LaTeX and code editors to write their drafts. So
why not do the same..</p>
<p>Again, it <strong>does not</strong> mean that I do not trust Microsoft. However, I am
not a big fan of telemetry involved with Visual Studio Code. Therefore,
while looking for an open source code editor, I came across <em>NeoVim</em>. Well,
first of all, setting up for NeoVim and most open source text editors is
not an easy task for someone new to computer science. After few hours of
fighting with terminal, I finally have NeoVim as my main text editor.</p>
<p>Debugging has different nuance from solving math problem. In other words,
I found a new type of challenge!! Especially, IOI (International Olympiad
of Informatics) and CTF (Capture the Flag) came into my sight. Although
some may say it is too late to start competitive programming as a high
school sophomore, I never think it&rsquo;s too late to learn anything. Yes, I
acknowledge that I might not be able to win competitions as a high school
student because there are people who studied much more than me and I
didn&rsquo;t start competitive programming as early as I started my journey
for math. However, I believe investigating my time in programming, learning
logics, and studying how computers operate would benefit me in the future.</p>
<h3 id="student-life">Student Life</h3>
<p>As I express and organize my thoughts through words, I would like to share
my student life. Especially as a student from an online high school, many
people wonder about my daily schedule. Everything is here!!</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>As one may have guessed, this category is for posts that do not fit to
categories above :))</p>
