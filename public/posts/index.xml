      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my third project, I decided to create a fun guess the number game. &lt;a href=&#34;https://enochyu-js.pages.dev/projects/project3_GuessTheNumber/&#34;&gt;Guess the Number&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/enochyu-official/js-mini-projects/tree/main/projects/project3_GuessTheNumber&#34;&gt;source codes&lt;/a&gt; are available. Please note that because I did not utilize internet for my script, the solution may not be the optimal version. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-project-3&#34;&gt;Introducing Project 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The product is rather simple. The client is given five chances to guess the random number between 1 and 100 inclusive. If the user guessed the number correctly, they are given the message &amp;ldquo;YOU WIN&amp;rdquo;. However, if the client was not able to guess the number within five tries, the random number appears with the message &amp;ldquo;YOU LOSE&amp;rdquo;. The script to activate the game was comparably simple. Below is a more detailed explanation on each components.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As for my second project, I decided to make a stopwatch. After reading and watching numerous tutorials, I was able to understand the general logic of JavaScript stopwatch. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://enochyu-js.pages.dev/projects/project2_TimerStopwatch/&#34;&gt;stopwatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/enochyu-official/js-mini-projects/tree/main/projects/project2_TimerStopwatch&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; are available. Please enjoy, and provide any feedback!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-project-2&#34;&gt;Introducing Project 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The stopwatch that I created behaves like any other stopwatch. It can start, pause, resume, and reset the counter accurately. Surprisingly, the general logical structure was much more easier to come up with than my &lt;a href=&#34;https://enochyu-js.pages.dev/projects/project1_CoffeeShop/&#34;&gt;first project&lt;/a&gt;. The method to calculate the elapsed time is finding the difference between current time and the time when the stopwatch started. The function &lt;code&gt;Date.now()&lt;/code&gt; will call the current time from the local machine up to milliseconds! Below is a more detailed explanation with source code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before getting started with competitive programming, I decided to&#xA;motivate myself with small JavaScript projects, mainly for growing&#xA;accustomed to coding and learning logics. As for my first JavaScript&#xA;mini-project, I decided to create a Coffee Shop simply because I&#xA;love coffee and coffee shops. For your reference, here is the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://enochyu-js.pages.dev/projects/project1_CoffeeShop/&#34;&gt;Coffee Shop&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;and the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/enochyu-official/js-mini-projects/tree/main/projects/project1_CoffeeShop&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;of the project. Please feel free to leave any feedback in the comment&#xA;section below for improvements!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accepting Failure: After Giving It My All</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post discusses about the recent emotional deterioration that I faced. If you are currently undergoing a challenge, I sincerely wish you to cheer up!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disqualification&#34;&gt;The Disqualification&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One may wonder: how big of a challenge can a high school student face? Well, I believe regardless of age, countless people encounter emotional challenges. For instance, failing an exam, receiving rejections, and breaking-up with the significant other may cause distress. As a student who wishes to major in pure mathematics, disqualifying from the second stage of team selecting process for the IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad) hit me hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building My Blog With Hugo and GitHub</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first decided to write my blog, I was thrown into bunch of options. I noticed that many of my favorite mathematicians including professor Terence Tao uses &lt;em&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/em&gt;. However, I noticed that &lt;em&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/em&gt; would generally give less control over my blog, and must pay to utilize many of the features. There I wondered, &lt;em&gt;why don&amp;rsquo;t I build one myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;static-site-generator-ssg&#34;&gt;Static Site Generator (SSG)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had two options of hosting via CMS (Content Management System) or hosting through SSG (Static Site Generator). The main difference is that CMS like Wordpress creates contents dynamically, whereas SSG is simply showing the users a pre-built sites. Here, I realized that most of my blogs would be text based, and does not require dynamic features such as user accounts. Moreover, sites created with SSG is much faster and secure compared to ones created with CMS since no server-side processing is required when accessing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!! Welcome to my personal blog where I post about various topics! I am a student from South Korea, and is currently attending Laurel Springs School. Please check out my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@enochyu_official/&#34;&gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/enochyu-official&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for more information!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-started-to-blog&#34;&gt;Why I Started to Blog&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always confident in writing. Although I am comfortable with using English, the thought that I do not sound like a &lt;strong&gt;native speaker&lt;/strong&gt;, when using casual term, kicks in. &lt;em&gt;Is my grammar wrong? Is my word choice not ideal? Am I using the word in a wrong way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
